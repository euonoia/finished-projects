​College Project Portfolio
​These projects represent the foundation of my skills as a Web Developer and were instrumental in my development as a Software Engineer.

​Functionality Overview

​The following core functionalities were successfully implemented across my projects:

​1. AxleEye
​Functionality: Automatically computes student grades and organizes students into their respective sections.

​Note: This was my first web system and a thesis capstone during Senior High School. It was a highly stressful introduction to managing both system development and research documentation simultaneously.

​2. Clinical
​Functionality: A comprehensive system to manage patients, allowing doctors to provide insights and printable information to patients.

​Note: I developed this system while my arm was literally fractured. Coding one-handed was a turning point that solidified my conviction for a career in software engineering.

​3. Parking
​Functionality: Manages parking slots, displays a history of audits, and computes the total income for the facility.

​Note: This system was developed with the same final exam deadline as Clinical while I was still recovering from my fractured arm. Successfully completing it boosted my confidence and reignited my passion for development.

​4. Emergency-Response
​Functionality: A system that sends the precise location of an emergency, featuring a working Google API and a community feature.

​Note: Since the incident makes my record to this subject is high at risk of failing luckily the third year student is also having a same position as I am have this system. I significantly fixed the UI/UX and debugged the non-functional user-admin chat feature in just a week of deadline and will present to the professor before the exam while my arm was still fractured. Despite the heavy improvements, the project still failed to pass the professor's criteria. It was a critical learning experience in code review, troubleshooting, and handling project adversity. But still I seen my potential and become quiet about it

​Overall Experience and Key Learnings

​Developing these web applications initially presented significant challenges. I distinctly recall the frustrations of not being able to debug seemingly simple problems. Over time, however, my debugging skills improved immensely. Similarly, what started as a difficult task—searching for and implementing various algorithms—has now become manageable and straightforward.
