this all my projects on my college days which is where my skill get enhanced as a web developer and become a Software Engineer!!


Functionality
The following required functionality is completed:

on AxleEye you can compute grades automatically and organize the student each sections

NOTE:
This is my first web system that also a thesis capstone on my Senior HighSchool days and this is FAR MORE STRESSING TO ME BACK THEN handling both systems and doing research paper but luckily i got someone on my relative really good at this stuffs 

Clinical you can manage patients and the doctor can give insights on the patients by giving them printed information

NOTE:
I made this system while my arms are broken literally FRACTURED! Coding at one hand sounds so aura farming but really this is my turning point that maybe this is what god really want me to do

on Parking you can manage parking slots here and show the history audits and can also compute the total income of the parking

NOTE:
Same with this system with a deadline of same finals together with the clinical i code this system while still recovering at my fractured arms but damn i feel so powerfull at making this system I got my momentum turning back my passion on here again

on Emergency-responce it can send location where is the emergency is and it got working google api have a community etc...

Notes:
we both have on the critical scenario with this third year student because my system AxleEye did not pass to one of our professor so he had this system and I look at it. The UI/UX is just so off it is not enhanced and the communication between user and admin on the chat is not even working so i fixed that chat and fixed the UI/UX still have a fractured arms overall it looks good but guess what? still our grade is 5.0 what a experience..

Overall Experience

Notes
Making this web applications at first makes me wonder how am I going to do this. the frustrations I had on my mind when I cannot debug
a simple problem but as the time goes by it makes it easier for me to debug it. And searching for different kinds of algorithms is so hard but now it is manageable.

DOCUMENTED PICTURE ON THIS SYSTEM COMMING SOON SO BUSY!!!
